# CASHEW BRITTLE

- [ ] 1c sugar
- [ ] 1c water
- [ ] 1c light corn syrup
- [ ] 2c cashews
- [ ] 1t vanilla[^1]
- [ ] 1/2t baking soda

Grease large cookie sheet (17x11in). Combine sugar, water & corn syrup in heavy-bottomed 3-qt. saucepan. cook, stirring occasionally over medium-high heat until temp. registers 275 on candy thermometer, or soft-crack stage, about 20 min. (mixture forms pliable strands when drizzled from a metal spoon). Sir in cashews. Continue cooking, stirring occasionally to prevent the nuts from scorching, until the temp. reaches 305, or hard-crack stage, 5 to 7 min. longer (mixture will be amber-colored and, when dropped into ice water and removed and bent, will snap). remove the saucepan from the heat. Quickly stir in the vanilla and the baking soda. Pour onto prepared cookie sheet, pushing brittle to edges of sheet with back of wooden spoon. As candy cools, stretch it out thinly by lifting and pulling from edges, using 2 forks. When brittle is completely cooled loosen from sheet; break into pieces. Store in airtight container at room temp. for up to 1 month.
